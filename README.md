# 📊 Part 1 – Churn Prediction with Python

## 🧠 Overview
This notebook tackles the problem of customer churn in a bank’s credit card services by leveraging Python for data exploration, feature engineering, and predictive modeling. The goal is to equip the bank with insights into which customers are most likely to leave — enabling early intervention and retention strategies.

## 📦 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle – Credit Card Customers](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers/data)
- Records: ~10,000 customer profiles with demographics, card usage, and churn status
- Target Variable: `Attrition_Flag` (Existing vs. Attrited customers)

## 🗂️ Key Steps
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis & Cleaning**
   - Detect missing values, outliers, and data distributions
   - Uncover patterns that correlate with customer attrition

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Transform and encode variables for modeling
   - Create new features based on behavior trends

3. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Train classifiers to estimate churn risk
   - Evaluate performance with metrics like precision, recall, ROC-AUC

4. **Insights for Action**
   - Interpret top predictors of churn
   - Set the foundation for stakeholder-driven visuals and business strategy

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook
